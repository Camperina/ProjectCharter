Sassy &amp; Sweet Boutique Database Proposal for System Analysis and Design (ITE 321)

The final project for my System Analysis and Design class was a presentation of what my website 
would look like. This class did not focus on web development so only the proposed layout of the 
site was created. We also had to write a project charter which included various diagrams, a 
project overview, a feasability assessment, and a financial assessment.
